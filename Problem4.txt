Assuming two pages exist under two different sub domains; one page is included inside the other one, using an iframe.
The parent page’s URL is: a.mydomain.com
The inner page’s URL is: b.mydomain.com
Is it possible for the parent page to call a JavaScript function of the inner page?
Yes or no, please explain the answer.

Calling a JS function of the inner page from the parent should be possible. However, there are some specifics to be
considered. Javascript's Same Origin Policy prevents access to properties and methods from different domains.
In the case given, in order to allow JavaScript interaction between the two documents, the document.domain properties
of a.mydomain.com and b.mydomain.comhave to be set to mydomain.com. Referencing the Iframe is possible using
getElementById. The Iframe element provides contentDocument and contentWindow, which grant you access to the
iframed document's objects and properties. A valid call to a function of the iframed document should look something like
    var win = document.getElementById('ifrm').contentWindow;
    win.functionCall();
